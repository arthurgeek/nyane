DESCRIPTION:
------------

Nyane means insignificant in [Sesotho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesotho), a [Bantu Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantu_languages). 

As it's name says, Nyane is an insignificant framework. It was build for educational purposes only. It's not intended to be used in production. 

Nyane is based on [Invisible](http://github.com/macournoyer/invisible/) (a nice pico-framework Rack-based) but way simpler.

INSTALLATION:
-------------

	git clone git://github.com/arthurgeek/nyane.git
	cd nyane
	gem build nyane.gemspec
	sudo gem install nyane --local

or

	sudo gem install arthurgeek-nyane --source=http://gems.github.com

DEMO APP:
------

	require "rubygems"
	require "nyane"
	
	app = Nyane.new do
	  get "/" do
	    "Hello!"
	  end
	  
	  get "/bye" do
	    "Goodbye"
	  end
	  
	  get "/echo/(.*)" do |text|
	    "#{text}"
	  end
	  
	end

	run app

ERB SUPPORT:
-------

Nyane supports ERB, but you need to explicitly require it

	require "rubygems"
	require "nyane"
	require "nyane/erb"
	
	app = Nyane.new do
	  get "/" do
	    erb :index
	  end
	  
	  get "/foo" do
	    erb :foo, :layout => false
	  end
	  
	end
	
	run app

The views need to be at `views/`. The layout used is `views/layout.erb`. To not render a layout, use `erb :template, :layout => false`. You can also tell which layout to use with `erb :template, :layout => :layout`

RUNNING THE APP:
-------

The app itself is a Rack config file, so, you can run with: `rackup demo.ru` and view it at `http://localhost:9292` or with Thin: `thin start -R demo.ru`

The extension needs to be .ru (rack config file)
